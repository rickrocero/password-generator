# password-generator

* My motivation for this assignment particulary was because this felt like it could be an interview question. So I wanted to do it right in the shortest time possible. However, it took me hours. In general, the motivation to solve tasks like this comes from the satisfaction of being able to do it. 

* I built this project to put my newly acquired JavaScript knowledge to the test. I built this project as a learning opportunity to practice JS.

* This solves the problem any website or service might have when its customers or employees need to generate a random password. 

* I learned about Web APIs and how to print a string based on user input. I learned that adding numbers passed single digits broke my code - What wasn't funny was how long it took me to figure that out. I learned that I need more a little more practice with if/else statements.
